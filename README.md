🧭 What I’m About  

I work at the intersection of government systems, data, and emerging technologies; exploring how applied AI can support real people in real institutions. Whether it’s jury panel logistics or digital literacy tools, I’m building the skills to automate workflows, structure knowledge, and communicate complex ideas with clarity and care.

🧶 FEATURED HACKATHON · ARIADNE CLEW

**Reasoning Preservation for LLM-Native Builders**  
**Building for AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon · AWS AgentCore + Claude Sonnet**

You build fast. You iterate messy. You lose track of why you made choices.  
Ariadne Clew is a reasoning agent that captures your messy chat sessions and turns them into structured clarity — preserving the **aha moments**, **design tradeoffs**, and **code decisions** that disappear when you move too fast for version control.

- 🧠 Powered by AWS AgentCore and Bedrock  
- 🧾 Produces structured recaps from raw Claude or ChatGPT transcripts  
- 💡 Designed for indie operators who hate losing context mid-build  
- 📂 [Repo](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/Ariadne-Clew)

🧵 In Greek mythology, Ariadne gave Theseus a clew — a thread to escape the labyrinth.  
Ariadne Clew does the same for LLM-native builders: capturing the **why** behind each decision before it disappears into the maze.

⚖️ Civic & Legal AI Projects  

**Jury Eligibility Chatbot**  
Prototype chatbot answering jury service questions using the California Code of Civil Procedure and Court Rules.  
Built with Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3) and a RAG-style architecture.  

- 🧠 Use case: Civic/legal operations  
- 🔗 [Repo: *Your Honor, I Object (to Jury Duty)* – v9](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/jury-chatbot)  
- 📺 [Demo (Loom)](https://www.loom.com/share/189bf95c6e8643da9188f85413daf56f?sid=634f2e81-8ac8-4328-8a54-9524c1a4231a)  
- 🛠️ Status: Prototype (v9)

**12 Angry Rows**  
Python ETL + reporting pipeline analyzing 11 years of jury utilization data.  
- 🛠️ Scripts: `juror_structure.py`, `juror_clean.py`, `juror_etl.py`  
- 📊 Benchmarks jury usage against NCSC standards  
- 📂 [Repo](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/12-angry-rows)  

**Write of Access**  
OCR + document extraction prototype using AWS Textract  
- 📑 Extracts typed and handwritten content from public court forms  
- 💬 Includes analysis of Textract limitations with checkboxes and freeform fields  
- 📂 [Repo](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/write-of-access)

**Hung Jury**  
When automation can’t reach a verdict.

This repo documents a scrubbed proof-of-concept exploring whether the Judicial Council of California’s Annual Jury Data Report (JDR) could be automated.  

- 🧪 Tested PDF extraction from Crystal Reports  
- 🗂️ Built `lean_jdr.py` to apply all 12 JCC Manual rules  
- 🧾 Concluded Excel was already validating correctly  
- 📂 [Repo](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/hung-jury)

🧠 What I Learned:  
- Source data quality is the real blocker — Crystal scrambled outputs  
- Python worked, but automation failed due to flawed PDFs  
- Knowing when to stop matters. This project was closed by Monday, with lessons intact  

Includes synthetic sample data, launch log, and script stubs (structure preserved, logic redacted). Developed with ChatGPT as build partner.
