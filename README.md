🧭 What I’m About  

I work at the intersection of government systems, data, and emerging technologies; exploring how applied AI can support real people in real institutions. Whether it’s jury panel logistics or digital literacy tools, I’m building the skills to automate workflows, structure knowledge, and communicate complex ideas with clarity and care.

🧪 FEATURED HACKATHON · ARIADNE CLEW  

**Built for the 2025 SuperHack, hosted by SuperOps + AWS**  
A lightweight agent orchestration prototype designed to handle IT tickets and trace agent chains through an explainable AI interface.

- 🧠 Claude 3.5 · React Frontend · Memory injection chain  
- 🧵 Supports fast debugging, code history review, and prompt chain transparency  
- 📂 [Repo](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/Ariadne-Clew)  

🏁 Built in under 72 hours. Built clean. More to come!

⚖️ Civic & Legal AI Projects  

**Jury Eligibility Chatbot**  
Prototype chatbot answering jury service questions using the California Code of Civil Procedure and Court Rules.  
Built with Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3) and a RAG-style architecture.  

- 🧠 Use case: Civic/legal operations  
- 🔗 [Repo: *Your Honor, I Object (to Jury Duty)* – v9](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/jury-chatbot)  
- 📺 [Demo (Loom)](https://www.loom.com/share/189bf95c6e8643da9188f85413daf56f?sid=634f2e81-8ac8-4328-8a54-9524c1a4231a)  
- 🛠️ Status: Prototype (v9)

**12 Angry Rows**  
Python ETL + reporting pipeline analyzing 11 years of jury utilization data.  
- 🛠️ Scripts: `juror_structure.py`, `juror_clean.py`, `juror_etl.py`  
- 📊 Benchmarks jury usage against NCSC standards  
- 📂 [Repo](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/12-angry-rows)  

**Write of Access**  
OCR + document extraction prototype using AWS Textract  
- 📑 Extracts typed and handwritten content from public court forms  
- 💬 Includes analysis of Textract limitations with checkboxes and freeform fields  
- 📂 [Repo](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/write-of-access)

**Hung Jury**  
When automation can’t reach a verdict.

This repo documents a scrubbed proof-of-concept exploring whether the Judicial Council of California’s Annual Jury Data Report (JDR) could be automated.  

- 🧪 Tested PDF extraction from Crystal Reports  
- 🗂️ Built `lean_jdr.py` to apply all 12 JCC Manual rules  
- 🧾 Concluded Excel was already validating correctly  
- 📂 [Repo](https://github.com/earlgreyhot1701D/hung-jury)

🧠 What I Learned:  
- Source data quality is the real blocker — Crystal scrambled outputs  
- Python worked, but automation failed due to flawed PDFs  
- Knowing when to stop matters. This project was closed by Monday, with lessons intact  

Includes synthetic sample data, launch log, and script stubs (structure preserved, logic redacted). Developed with ChatGPT as build partner.
