🧭 **What I’m About**  
I work at the intersection of government systems, data, and emerging technologies — exploring how applied AI can support real people in real institutions.  
Whether it’s jury panel logistics or civil grand jury communications, I’m building the skills to automate workflows, structure knowledge, and communicate complex ideas with clarity and care.

## 🧠 Project Highlight: Bedrock Chatbot (AI Camp Prep)

Built and deployed a working conversational AI chatbot using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) as part of my CCC AI Summer Camp preparation.

The app uses Claude 3 Sonnet to answer plain-language questions about California jury duty, showcasing how generative AI can support public understanding of government services.
