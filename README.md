🧭 **What I’m About**  
I work at the intersection of government systems, data, and emerging technologies — exploring how applied AI can support real people in real institutions.  
Whether it’s jury panel logistics or civil grand jury communications, I’m building the skills to automate workflows, structure knowledge, and communicate complex ideas with clarity and care.
