## 🧭 What I'm About

I work at the intersection of government systems, developer workflows, and emerging AI. I build full-stack systems that make invisible things visible—whether it's developer growth, legal processes, or civic workflows. Nine years in judicial operations taught me how real systems fail. Now I'm building tools to fix them.

## 🚀 FEATURED PROJECT · JANUS CLEW

**Evidence-Backed Developer Growth Tracking**

Building for AWS Global Vibe Hackathon 2025 · AWS AgentCore + FastAPI + React

You ship projects. You grow. But growth is invisible—until now.

Janus Clew reads your actual code, measures complexity objectively, detects what you're learning, and exports proof you can share.

**Phase 1 shipped:** CLI analyzer + FastAPI backend + React dashboard
- Timeline visualization of growth across projects
- Skills detected with evidence links to your actual code
- Complexity breakdown showing exactly how the score was calculated
- Shareable export (LinkedIn-ready, interview-proof)

**Phase 2 complete:** Pattern detection + AWS AgentCore integration
- Detects your development signature (database avoidance, async-first, etc.)
- AI-powered forward-looking recommendations ("you're ready for PostgreSQL")
- Growth trajectory analysis with confidence levels

Built for indie operators and solo developers who move fast and need proof, not vibes. Local-first, privacy-focused.

🧠 Full-stack: CLI + FastAPI + React + AWS AgentCore  
📊 Real problem: Growth is invisible  
💡 Real solution: Evidence-backed proof

## 🧶 ARIADNE CLEW

**Reasoning Preservation for LLM-Native Builders**

AWS AgentCore + Claude Sonnet 4 + Bedrock

You build fast. You iterate messy. You lose track of why you made choices.

Ariadne Clew is an autonomous reasoning agent that captures your messy chat sessions and turns them into structured clarity—preserving the aha moments, design tradeoffs, and code decisions that disappear when you move too fast for version control.

**What it does:**
- Upload any LLM chat transcript (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.)
- Agent autonomously extracts: aha moments, MVP changes, scope creep, README notes, post-MVP ideas
- Produces dual output: human-readable recap + structured JSON
- Session persisted for historical reference

**Why it matters:**
- 73% of developers use AI coding tools daily, but 0% preserve structured reasoning
- Designed for indie operators who hate losing context mid-build
- Production-grade security: PII scrubbing, deny-list filtering, size enforcement
- Real AWS AgentCore integration (not mocked)

🤖 True agentic behavior: autonomous operation, zero human in loop  
🧾 Dual output: human + machine-readable  
🔐 Security-first: filters, validation, schema enforcement

## 🎮 TICKETGLASS

**AI-Powered IT Support Transparency**

Customers can finally see what's happening with their IT support tickets—no more black box.

Problem: IT support tickets are opaque. Customers don't know what's happening, why it's happening, or if their issue will be repeated.

Solution: Real-time updates, context-aware explanations, never repeated solutions. Built with AWS Bedrock + Claude AI.

**What shipped:**
- Real-time ticket visibility
- AI-powered context and explanations
- Solution tracking to prevent repetition
- Built for SuperHack 2025

🤖 AWS Bedrock + Claude AI  
👀 Transparency-first design  
🔄 Smart solution tracking

## ⚖️ Civic & Legal AI Projects

**Jury Eligibility Chatbot**
Prototype chatbot answering jury service questions using the California Code of Civil Procedure and Court Rules.

Built with Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3) and RAG architecture.

**12 Angry Rows**
Python ETL + reporting pipeline analyzing 11 years of jury utilization data.

Benchmarks jury usage against NCSC standards. Shows opportunities for court reform.

**Write of Access**
OCR + document extraction prototype using AWS Textract.

Extracts typed and handwritten content from public court forms. Documents Textract's actual limitations.

**Hung Jury**
When automation can't reach a verdict.

Proof-of-concept exploring whether Crystal Reports PDFs could be automated. Conclusion: source data quality is the real blocker, not the Python script.

## 🧠 Development Philosophy

**Occam's Razor:** Simple, focused solution over feature bloat. Solve one problem completely before adding the next.

**Single Responsibility:** Every component, every function, every project does one thing and does it well. No Swiss Army knives.

**Vibe Coding:** Human-AI partnership. AI serves as thinking partner, not code generator.

**Security-First:** PII protection, content filtering, guardrails baked in early.

**Ship Fast, Test Hard:** Pragmatic MVPs where it matters, rigorous testing for core logic.

**Build for Edge Cases:** Solo builders, indie operators, underserved communities.

**Operational Thinking:** 9 years in judicial systems taught me how real systems fail.
